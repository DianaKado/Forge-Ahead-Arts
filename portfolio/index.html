      <p>We create art installations and events that stimulate creativity<br>and dialogue in Santa Clarita. Undoubtedly it will continue to<br>evolve, but for now, our work falls falls into 3 broad categories: </p>
      <div class="gray three-categories">
        <a href="btpftp/index.html"><div class="column1">
          <h3>by the people for the people</h3>
          <img src="resources/images/barriers.jpg" alt="barriers">
          <p>The first category are participatory public art works that are designed and led by an artist, but created by members of the community. So far we have completed 5 of these projects. </p>
        </div></a>
        <a href="pe/index.html"><div class="column2">
          <h3>participatory events</h3>
          <img src="resources/images/sweetshop.jpg" alt="sweetshop">
          <p>Our second category of programing includes participatory installations and events. Although there is some overlap, these are different from the “by the people for the people” pieces in the way that the community participates.</p>
        </div></a>
        <a href="ai/index.html"><div class="column3">
          <h3>artist installations</h3>
          <img src="resources/images/specimens.jpg" alt="specimens">
          <p>Finally we have also produced two installations that are not participatory. We hope to build on this kind of programing with additional pieces as well as continuing to expand the circle of artists with whom we are working.</p>
